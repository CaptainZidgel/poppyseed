An environment (I am using that word to make it sound complex and interesting) for testing matchmaking algorithms.
Basically, it allows you to spawn a bunch of users with random elo scores and stuff.
I'm developing it so I can use it myself to implement a 1:1 MM algorithm but you could use it for N:N if you wanted.
